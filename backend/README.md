# Jabba The Hut's Hit List
### Technical Description: 
A full stack App with CRUD functioning, incorporating:
* Ruby on Rails as the backend
* Vanilla Javascript on the front end

<br />

### App Description:
Help us, you're our only hope! In a time of civil unrest, Jabba the hut is on a mission to squash his enemies with whatever means necessary! Jabba the Hut's Hit List is a web application that showcases most of the major characters from the starwars universe. Each character card showcases their image, name, character type and a brief description about who they are. A user can "Choose Their Path" and fulfill their destiny by creating their own character card.

        Instructions: 
            * cd into the backend and run "rails s" in the terminal to begin the server
            * cd into the frontend and run "open index.html" in the terminal to start the web application (do this step in a new terminal window)
